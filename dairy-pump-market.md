<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dairy pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-displacement</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dairy pump market consists primarily of two types: positive-displacement pumps and centrifugal pumps. Positive-displacement pumps move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it into the discharge pipe, making them ideal for thick dairy products. In contrast, centrifugal pumps use a rotating impeller to create flow, making them suitable for low-viscosity fluids. Each type serves specific applications in dairy processing, with positive-displacement pumps excelling in accuracy for viscous materials, while centrifugal pumps offer efficiency for lighter liquids.</p></p>
