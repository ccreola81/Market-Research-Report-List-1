<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Regenerative Desiccant Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heatless</li><li>Heated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Regenerative desiccant dryers are categorized into two main types: heatless and heated. Heatless dryers utilize ambient air to regenerate the desiccant material, making them energy-efficient but suitable for specific applications due to limited drying capacity. Heated dryers, on the other hand, force heated air through the desiccant bed, enhancing regeneration speed and efficiency. These are ideal for larger volumes of compressed air and applications requiring consistent dryness, offering improved performance at a potentially higher energy cost.</p></p>
