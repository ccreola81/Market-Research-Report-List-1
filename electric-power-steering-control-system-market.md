<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Power Steering Control System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Hydraulic</li><li>Electrohydraulic</li><li>Electric Assist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electric Power Steering (EPS) Control System market includes three main types: Mechanical Hydraulic, Electrohydraulic, and Electric Assist. Mechanical Hydraulic systems use hydraulic pressure generated by an engine-driven pump to assist steering, offering reliability but lower efficiency. Electrohydraulic systems combine hydraulic assistance with electric motors for improved efficiency and control. Electric Assist systems eliminate hydraulics entirely, relying on electric motors for precise, energy-efficient steering assistance, making them lighter and more adaptable to advanced driver-assistance features. Each type caters to varying performance, efficiency, and cost requirements.</p></p>
