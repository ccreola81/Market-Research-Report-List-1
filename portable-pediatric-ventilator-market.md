<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Pediatric Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Portable Pediatric Ventilator Market is segmented into intrusive and non-invasive types. Intrusive ventilators require endotracheal intubation, delivering airflow directly into the patient's airway, making them suitable for critically ill children needing comprehensive respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, employ masks or nasal interfaces, providing respiratory assistance without invasive procedures. This type is often used for milder respiratory issues, offering greater comfort and mobility, thereby enhancing overall patient experience in pediatric healthcare settings.</p></p>
