<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The EUV Photoresist Developer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Developer</li><li>Negative Photoresist Developer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The EUV photoresist developer market is primarily divided into two types: positive and negative photoresist developers. Positive photoresist developers are designed to dissolve exposed areas of photoresist after exposure to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light, facilitating the patterning of intricate features on semiconductor wafers. Conversely, negative photoresist developers solidify the exposed areas, allowing the unexposed regions to be washed away. Both types are crucial for the photolithography process in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, catering to different design requirements and resolutions.</p></p>
